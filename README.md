# Minimal API with ASP.NET Core

Welcome to the Minimal API with ASP.NET Core repository! This project serves as a minimalistic example of building a web API using ASP.NET Core, focusing on simplicity and ease of understanding.

## Overview
This project showcases the basics of creating a minimal API with ASP.NET Core, demonstrating how to set up endpoints and handle HTTP requests and responses.

## Features
+ *Endpoint Configuration:* Simple setup of API endpoints.
+ *Routing:* Basic routing for handling different HTTP requests.
+ *Request and Response Handling:* Handling incoming requests and crafting appropriate responses.
+ *Middleware:* Introduction to middleware for additional processing.
